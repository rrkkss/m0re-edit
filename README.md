### PHOTOS
* [HUD ALBUM](https://imgur.com/a/Vz678vL) (things not changed can be seen in the second link)
* [ORIGINAL HUD](http://imgur.com/a/2gckG) for Hypnotize's version

### SUGGESTED SETTINGS
* cl_crosshair_red 108; cl_crosshair_green 255; cl_crosshair_blue 89 (that is accent colour)
* hud_combattext_red 108; hud_combattext_green 255; hud_combattext_blue 89
* tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 1 (because floating health doesn't always update (de)buffs)

### ISSUES
* there are some deleted files and empty hud objects, therefore modes that I don't play (MvM, mannpower, and others) may not work properly

WIP - contact me or open up an issue if you encounter something
